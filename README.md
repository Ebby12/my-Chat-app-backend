ChatBoardApplication
The ChatBoardApplication class serves as the entry point for the chat application developed using Spring Boot.
Add this class to your Spring Boot project under the appropriate package (com.chat_application.chatboard in this example).

Annotate the class with @SpringBootApplication to indicate that it is a Spring Boot application. This annotation combines several commonly used annotations, including @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

Implement the main method, which serves as the starting point of the application. Inside the main method, use SpringApplication.run(ChatBoardApplication.class, args) to launch the Spring Boot application.

Run the main method, and Spring Boot will start the application, initialize the necessary components, and configure the application based on the classpath and configuration files.

#Compatibility
This code is compatible with Spring Boot applications and provides a basic setup for launching a chat application. It leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning capabilities.
